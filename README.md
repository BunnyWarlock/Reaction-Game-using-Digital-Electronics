# Reaction-Game-using-Digital-Electronics
This is the project I wanted to submit for my digital logic course before the faculty gave everyone a common project  :(        
This game requires 3 pople (1 judge and 2 players). The judge is there is press a button which will turn on the light, and the player to click their button when the light goes off wins. If a player presses their button when the light is off then the other player wins. The fun part is if this is made physically then the judge can easily juke the players by pretending to press the button, so the best tactic for the players is to keep an eye out for the light and not the judge's hand.     
In Logisim go to simulate and set the tick frequency to some high value like 1kHz. It just needs to be fast enough to not seem laggy or unresponsive. Then turn on ticks enable and enjoy playing the game.     
If the file does not work in logisim after downloading it then just copy paste the source code in notepad and save the file with a .circ extension at the end. It should work then.      
Have fun.
